# Live Video Frame Capture with Ring Buffer

This Python code demonstrates a live video frame capture system using a ring buffer. It consists of a `RingBuffer` class for implementing the ring buffer data structure.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python` package)
- NumPy (`numpy` package)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install opencv-python numpy
    ```

3. Use the `RingBuffer` class in your Python script as needed.

## Functionality
- The `RingBuffer` class facilitates the exchange of images between producer and consumer threads in a live video system.
- It supports adding frames to the buffer by the producer and retrieving frames from the buffer by the consumer.

## Files
- `ring_buffer.py`: Contains the `RingBuffer` class for implementing the ring buffer data structure.
